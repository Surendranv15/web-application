# web-application
Creating a web application for employee management involves several components: frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, Bootstrap) and backend (PHP, MySQL) development, along with session management and file uploading functionalities. Below, I'll provide detailed documentation for each component, explaining their purpose, implementation, and interaction within the application.

# Project Structure
Here’s an organized structure for your project:

# Detailed Documentation
1. Database Setup (db_config.php)
Purpose: This file establishes a connection to the MySQL database where employee data is stored.

Code Explanation:

php
<?php
$servername = "localhost"; // Replace with your server name
$username = "username";    // Replace with your database username
$password = "password";    // Replace with your database password
$dbname = "employee_db";   // Replace with your database name

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
Usage: Include db_config.php in PHP files that require database access, ensuring secure and efficient database operations.

2. Session Management (session.php)
Purpose: Manages user sessions to authenticate and maintain login state across pages.

Code Explanation:

php
Copy code
<?php
session_start();

// Check if user is logged in
function check_login() {
    if (!isset($_SESSION['logged_in']) || $_SESSION['logged_in'] !== true) {
        header("Location: login.html");
        exit;
    }
}

// Logout function
function logout() {
    $_SESSION = array();
    session_destroy();
    header("Location: login.html");
    exit;
}
?>
Usage: Use check_login() function to restrict access to pages based on user login status. logout() function enables secure logout functionality.

3. Helper Functions (functions.php)
Purpose: Provides reusable functions, such as file upload handling, for the application.

Code Explanation:

php
Copy code
<?php
// Function to upload profile picture
function upload_profile_picture($file) {
    $target_dir = "uploads/";
    $target_file = $target_dir . basename($file["name"]);
    $uploadOk = 1;
    $imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($target_file, PATHINFO_EXTENSION));

    // Check if image file is a actual image or fake image
    $check = getimagesize($file["tmp_name"]);
    if ($check !== false) {
        $uploadOk = 1;
    } else {
        return "File is not an image.";
    }

    // Check file size
    if ($file["size"] > 500000) {
        return "Sorry, your file is too large.";
    }

    // Allow certain file formats
    if ($imageFileType != "jpg" && $imageFileType != "png" && $imageFileType != "jpeg"
        && $imageFileType != "gif") {
        return "Sorry, only JPG, JPEG, PNG & GIF files are allowed.";
    }

    // Check if $uploadOk is set to 0 by an error
    if ($uploadOk == 0) {
        return "Sorry, your file was not uploaded.";
    } else {
        if (move_uploaded_file($file["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
            return $target_file;
        } else {
            return "Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.";
        }
    }
}
?>
Usage: upload_profile_picture() handles file uploads for employee profile pictures, validating file type, size, and moving files to the designated directory (uploads/).

4. Login Page (login.html and login.php)
Purpose: Allows users to authenticate and access the employee management system securely.

Implementation:

login.html: Contains the login form.
login.php: Processes login credentials, validates against hardcoded values (for simplicity; in practice, use secure methods like hashing and prepared statements).
Usage: Upon successful login, $_SESSION['logged_in'] is set to true, enabling access to protected pages like index.php.

5. Employee Management (index.html and index.php)
Purpose: Displays a list of employees, allows CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Implementation:

index.html: UI for displaying employees and managing CRUD operations.
index.php: Handles CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and integrates with db_config.php, session.php, and functions.php.
Usage: Ensures secure and efficient management of employee data, including file upload for profile pictures (crud.php handles form submissions for CRUD operations).

6. CRUD Operations (crud.php)
Purpose: Implements Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for employee records.

Implementation:

Receives form submissions from index.html via index.php.
Executes SQL queries (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE) on employees table in employee_db.
Usage: Enables users to add new employees (Create), view employee details (Read), update employee information (Update), and delete employees (Delete) securely.

Summary
This detailed documentation outlines each component's purpose, code implementation, and usage within the employee management web application. Ensure to adapt and enhance the code based on specific project requirements, security considerations, and best practices in web development.
